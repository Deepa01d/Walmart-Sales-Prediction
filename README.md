# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
The project focused on analyzing Walmart's sales data to derive insights and build predictive models. The main steps included:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Loaded and explored the dataset.
Cleaned and processed the data for analysis, handling missing values and categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to understand the distribution of data.
Visualized data using various plots to identify trends and patterns.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.
Selected the most relevant features based on statistical methods and domain knowledge.
Model Building:
decision trees
Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy.

Model Evaluation:

Compared the performance of different models.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Conclusion:

The project successfully identified key factors influencing sales.
The final model provided accurate sales predictions, which can help Walmart optimize their inventory and sales strategies.
